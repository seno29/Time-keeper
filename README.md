# time_keeper

Time keeper app will allow users to practice pomodoro
technique (time management method) that aims to maximize
focus and creative freshness, hence helping users to maximize
productivity.

The technique uses a timer to break down work into
intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by
short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the
Italian word for 'tomato'. Regular breaks are taken, aiding
assimilation. A short (3–5 minutes) rest separates consecutive
pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15–30
minute) rest is taken between sets.

The goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal
and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is
indivisible; when interrupted during a pomodoro, either the
other activity must be recorded and postponed (using the
inform – negotiate – schedule – call back strategy) or the
pomodoro must be abandoned.

This app is ideal for people who find it difficult to get started
on any task and tend to procrastinate until deadline.
